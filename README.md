# Telecom Customer Churn Attrition Prediction

In today's competitive telecom industry, retaining customers is more important than ever. Customer churn, or when users leave for another provider, can significantly impact a company's bottom line. This project focuses on building a predictive model to help identify which customers are likely to leave based on their usage patterns, behavior, and other factors. By understanding these patterns, companies can act early to keep customers happy and reduce churn.

This repository includes everything needed to analyze customer churn, from the dataset to the code used for predictions. It also offers insights into key factors driving customer attrition and suggests strategies to help telecom companies improve customer retention. For a quick overview, watch the YouTube video linked below.

## Problem Statement

In the dynamic landscape of the telecommunications industry, customers wield the power to choose from a plethora of service providers for their communication and internet needs. Customer satisfaction plays a pivotal role as users often form opinions about an entire company based on a single interaction. The ubiquitous nature of communication services, intertwined with our daily lives, underscores the significance of understanding and mitigating customer churn.

Churn rate, a key metric representing the number of customers who terminate or do not renew their subscriptions, directly impacts revenue. Given the high costs associated with acquiring new customers, an in-depth churn analysis is imperative. Insights derived from this analysis empower companies to formulate strategic approaches, target specific segments, enhance service quality, and ultimately foster trust with their customers. Building predictive models and generating comprehensive reports through churn analysis thus becomes instrumental in driving sustainable growth.

## Objective

The primary objective is to develop a robust predictive model capable of classifying potential churn customers based on a comprehensive set of numerical and categorical features. This poses a binary classification challenge, considering the inherent imbalance in the dataset.

1. **Dataset Overview and Attributes:**
   Providing an in-depth look into the dataset, detailing various attributes such as customerID, gender, SeniorCitizen status, partnership, dependents, tenure, phone services, and more.

2. **Customer Profile Details:**
   Highlighting key customer-related information, covering aspects like demographics, service usage, contract terms, billing preferences, and payment methods.

3. **Internet and Service Features:**
   Elaborating on the availability of internet services and specific features such as online security, backup, device protection, tech support, streaming TV, and streaming movies.

4. **Contract and Billing Information:**
   Describing the terms of customer contracts, paperless billing preferences, payment methods employed, and the associated monthly and total charges.

5. **Churn Status and Analytics Process:**
   Delving into the critical aspect of customer churn, outlining the notebook's contents, which include Dataset Information, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Summary of EDA, Feature Engineering, Modeling, and a Conclusion.

6. **Utilize Power BI for Visual Insights:**
   Implementing Power BI to create interactive visualizations and dashboards that provide deep insights into churn patterns, customer segments, and predictive model performance. This includes visual representations of churn trends, customer demographics, and service usage patterns to facilitate strategic decision-making.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Curated a comprehensive dataset comprising customer demographics, service usage details, contract specifics, and billing preferences.
   - Employed rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to ensure data integrity and consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted in-depth EDA to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and anomalies within the dataset.
   - Visualized key metrics such as customer segmentation by contract type and churn propensity across different customer segments using tools like Power BI for interactive visualizations.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Developed and fine-tuned machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Evaluated model performance based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score to select the optimal model for churn prediction.

4. **Power BI for Visual Insights:**
   - Implemented Power BI to create interactive dashboards and visualizations that provide intuitive insights into churn patterns.
   - Visualized model predictions, feature importance, and customer segmentation to facilitate strategic decision-making and operational planning.
